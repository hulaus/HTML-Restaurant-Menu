       <h2>Origin Story</h2>
       <p>The Creator of H-Thai-ML, Jo Carr, had two loves besides his dogs and family and that was computer programming and cooking. After a few years of learning dishes around the world he opened his own restaurant dedicated to the dishes he loved to make and eat in Las Vegas to stay close to his family and grow his restaurant's name recognition being part of one of the biggest tourist hot spots in the world. After finding success in Las Vegas he then opened his new locations in California, New York & now open in Florida. He promised to bring the authenticity of Thai Culture through every dish. Using only the freshest ingridients and best combinations of flavors our guests always leave happy and ready to come back for more !  </p>
